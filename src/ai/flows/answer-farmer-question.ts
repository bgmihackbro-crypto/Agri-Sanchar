        - Common Types: Sucking pests (aphids, whiteflies, jassids), chewing pests (bollworms, stem borers).
        - Symptoms: Yellowing leaves, holes in leaves or fruits, wilting, sticky "honeydew" substance.
        - Management: Use of insecticides (chemical or organic), pheromone traps, encouraging natural predators.
    </INSECT_INFESTATION>
    <FUNGAL_DISEASE>
        - Definition: Diseases caused by pathogenic fungi that infect plants.
        - Common Types: Rusts, smuts, mildews, blights, wilts.
        - Symptoms: Spots on leaves (yellow, brown, black), powdery growth, wilting, root rot.

    </FUNGAL_DISEASE>
    <BACTERIAL_DISEASE>
        - Definition: Diseases caused by bacteria. They often enter plants through wounds or natural openings.
        - Common Types: Bacterial blight, bacterial leaf spot, citrus canker.
        - Symptoms: Water-soaked spots on leaves that turn dark, wilting, oozing from plant parts.

        - Principles: Monitoring pests, using chemical pesticides only when necessary, and choosing the least toxic options.
    </INTEGRATED_PEST_MANAGEMENT_IPM>
    <PESTICIDE_RESISTANCE>
        - Definition: The decreased susceptibility of a pest population to a pesticide that was previously effective.
        - Cause: Repeated use of the same type of pesticide over time, which selects for resistant individuals in the pest population.

    </PESTICIDE_RESISTANCE>
  </PEST_MANAGEMENT>
  
  <CROP_MANAGEMENT>
    <CROP_ROTATION>
        - Definition: The practice of growing a series of different types of crops in the same area across a sequence of growing seasons.
        - Benefits: Improves soil health and fertility, reduces soil erosion, helps control pests and weeds, and increases crop yield.
        - Example: Planting a legume crop like gram or lentil after a cereal crop like rice or wheat helps to replenish soil nitrogen. A common rotation in North India is Rice-Wheat.
    </CROP_ROTATION>
    <SOWING_METHODS>
        - Broadcasting: Scattering seeds by hand over the field. It's a quick but inefficient method, leading to uneven plant density.
        - Drilling/Line Sowing: Sowing seeds in rows at a uniform depth using a seed drill. It ensures better germination and makes intercultural operations like weeding easier.
        - Transplanting: Raising seedlings in a nursery and then planting them in the main field. Common for crops like rice and many vegetables. It allows for better initial care and selection of healthy seedlings.
    </SOWING_METHODS>

    </GERMINATION>
    <GROWTH_STAGES>
        - Seedling Stage: The initial stage after germination, where the young plant establishes its roots and first leaves.
        - Vegetative Stage: The period of rapid growth where the plant develops its leaves, stems, and roots. The plant accumulates energy for the reproductive phase.
        - Reproductive Stage (Flowering/Fruiting): The stage where the plant produces flowers, fruits, and seeds. This stage is critical for yield. Nutrient and water requirements are often highest during this phase.
        - Maturity Stage: The final stage where the crop ripens and is ready for harvest.
    </GROWTH_STAGES>
    <WEED_CONTROL>
        - Definition: The process of limiting weed infestation so that crops can be grown profitably.
        - Manual Weeding: Removing weeds by hand or using hand tools like a khurpi. It is labor-intensive but effective for small areas.
        - Mechanical Weeding: Using animal-drawn or tractor-drawn implements (like cultivators or hoes) to remove weeds between crop rows.
        - Chemical Weeding (Herbicides): Using chemicals to kill weeds. Herbicides can be pre-emergent (applied before weeds appear) or post-emergent (applied after weeds appear). It is crucial to use the correct herbicide for the crop and weed type to avoid crop damage.
    </WEED_CONTROL>
  </CROP_MANAGEMENT>

  <IRRIGATION_WATER_MANAGEMENT>
      <DRIP_IRRIGATION>
        - Definition: A type of micro-irrigation system that saves water and nutrients by allowing water to drip slowly to the roots of plants, either from above the soil surface or buried below the surface.
        - Advantages: High water efficiency (up to 95%), reduces weed growth, allows for fertigation (applying fertilizers with water).
        - Suitable for: Row crops (vegetables, cotton), orchards, vineyards, and greenhouse cultivation.
      </DRIP_IRRIGATION>
      <SPRINKLER_IRRIGATION>
        - Definition: A method of applying irrigation water which is similar to natural rainfall. Water is distributed through a system of pipes by pumping and sprayed into the air.
        - Advantages: Suitable for sandy soils where water percolates quickly, can cover large and uneven areas, helps in cooling the micro-climate during high temperatures.
        - Disadvantages: Can be affected by high winds, leading to uneven distribution. Higher evaporative losses compared to drip irrigation.
      </SPRINKLER_IRRIGATION>
      <WATER_HARVESTING>
        - Definition: The collection and storage of rainwater and runoff for reuse on-site, rather than allowing it to run off and be lost.
        - Methods: Farm ponds (Talab), check dams (Bandhara), rooftop rainwater harvesting into tanks, percolation tanks to recharge groundwater.
        - Importance: Recharges groundwater levels, provides a crucial source of supplemental irrigation during dry spells, and reduces soil erosion.
      </WATER_HARVESTING>
      <CANAL_IRRIGATION>
        - Definition: A system where water is diverted from rivers or reservoirs into a network of canals (main canals, branch canals, distributaries) to irrigate fields. It's a major source of irrigation in states like Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh.
        - Challenges: Water availability depends on the government's release schedule ('Warabandi' system), potential for waterlogging and soil salinity if drainage is poor, and tail-end farmers often receive less water.
      </CANAL_IRRIGATION>
      <GROUNDWATER_IRRIGATION>
          - Definition: Extracting water from underground aquifers using tube wells or borewells. It is a critical source of irrigation in India.
          - Importance: Provides a reliable and on-demand water supply, giving farmers control over irrigation timing.
          - Challenges: Over-extraction is leading to a rapid decline in groundwater levels in many parts of the country, increased electricity costs for pumping, and risk of water contamination (e.g., with arsenic, fluoride).
      </GROUNDWATER_IRRIGATION>
      <WATER_CONSERVATION>
          - Definition: The practice of using water efficiently to reduce unnecessary water usage.
          - Techniques:
            - Mulching: Covering the soil surface with organic (straw, husk) or plastic mulch to reduce evaporation.
            - Laser Land Leveling: Creating a perfectly flat field to ensure uniform water distribution and reduce water loss.
            - Zero Tillage: Planting crops directly into the residue of the previous crop without tilling the soil, which helps retain soil moisture.
            - Choosing water-efficient crops (e.g., millets, pulses) in water-scarce areas.

        - Micronutrients: Nutrients required in smaller quantities but are still essential for plant growth, such as Zinc (Zn), Iron (Fe), Boron (B), and Manganese (Mn). Deficiencies can cause poor growth.
    </SOIL_FERTILITY>
    <PH_LEVEL>
        - Definition: A measure of how acidic or alkaline the soil is. A pH of 7 is neutral. Below 7 is acidic, and above 7 is alkaline.
        - Importance: Soil pH affects nutrient availability. Most crops prefer a pH range of 6.0 to 7.5.
        - Management: Lime can be added to acidic soils to raise pH. Gypsum or organic matter can be used on alkaline soils to lower pH.
    </PH_LEVEL>
    <SOIL_MOISTURE>
        - Definition: The water held in the spaces between soil particles.
        - Importance: Essential for nutrient transport and photosynthesis. Proper soil moisture is critical for seed germination and plant growth.
